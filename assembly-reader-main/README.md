# Assembly
#### Activity of Architecture and Organization of Processors II taught by Thiago Felski Pereira

### Description


Write a program that, upon input from an instruction memory file, (ROM) in machine language (hexadecimal), display the total number of cycles average cost and number of cycles per instruction (CPI) for the program.

The program must be able to classify all the instructions used in the activities of MIPS programming in the discipline of Computer Architecture I, comprising direct instructions and those generated by pseudo-instructions.

Consider sequential program execution on a MIPS processor with multicycle organization. After surveying the cycles, submit a report with sorting the instructions according to the number of cycles.
