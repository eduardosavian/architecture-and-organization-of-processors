# Cache-Simulator
#### Activity of Architecture and Organization of Processors II taught by Thiago Felski Pereira

### Description

- The cache size must be dynamically defined, that is, the user will say the number of cache blocks;

- Ensure consistency for a cache with size equal to a power of 2;

- The work should evaluate the success of the cache (percentage of hits) for all possible cache associativities;

- The work must allow the user to display the cache for a given associativity;

- The input data (address and value) must be read from a file to be passed by the professor;

- The cache must have a dirty bit and a data, because if this data is modified, at the end of the execution, the memory file must be updated for all cache positions where the dirt bit is equal to 1.
